This repository holds a README.md file. In the file there is information about what school I'm attending and the courses. And what my goals are with this program.
 My name is Katie Prohaska, I am 22 years old and a mother of 2
 My end goal with this course is too feel confident in what codes I write and to learn enough to get a job in the developer field!
